# Second Mind -- Progress Log
# Append-only. Each iteration writes what was built, learned, and gotchas.

## SM-001: Discovery and environment verification
- Node.js: v25.6.0 (>= 20 ✓)
- npm: 11.9.0 ✓
- Supabase CLI: 2.75.0 ✓
- Docker: 29.2.0, running ✓
- Starting repo files: README.md, prd.json, prompt.md, progress.txt, second-mind-spec.md, preflight.sh, .git/, .claude/
- This is a greenfield project — no app code exists yet
- Architecture confirmed from spec: Next.js App Router, Supabase + pgvector, Anthropic Claude API, Tailwind CSS
- Key decisions: Cmd+K command bar UI, memory files as markdown briefing docs, LLM-based context routing, warm "paper feel" aesthetic
- No code changes made (discovery only)

## SM-002: Project scaffolding
- Scaffolded Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind v4
- Warm neutral palette configured via CSS variables: background #faf8f5, foreground #1a1a1a, muted #6b6b6b, accent #e8e4df, border #d4d0cb
- Tailwind v4 uses @theme inline in CSS instead of tailwind.config.ts
- Created directories: lib/, components/, app/api/, types/, scripts/
- Landing page renders "Second Mind" text
- npm run build succeeds with zero errors
- All pre-existing files preserved
- Gotcha: Tailwind v4 config is CSS-based, not JS/TS config file based
